                                Chandrayaan-3 is the third and most recent lunar exploration mission under Chandrayaan programme. It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.
                                Following Chandrayaan-2, where a last-minute glitch in the landing guidance software led to the lander crashing after entering lunar orbit, another lunar mission was proposed.
                                The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST and lunar injection of 100 km circular polar orbit was completed successfully as part of phase one. The lander and rover are expected to land near the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023.

                                <br><br>

                            Chandrayaan-3 Propulsion Module
                            The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with one large solar panel mounted on one side and a large cylinder on top (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) that acts as a mounting structure for the lander. In addition to the lander, the module carries a payload called Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) to study the spectral and polarimetric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1-1.7 Î¼m).
                            <br><br>

                            Chandrayaan-3 Lander<br><br>
                            The lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters of 800 newtons each. It will carry the rover and various scientific instruments to perform in-site analysis.

                            The lander for Chandrayaan-3 will have only four throttle-able engines, unlike Vikram on Chandrayaan-2 which had five 800 Newtons engines with a fifth one being centrally mounted with a fixed thrust.[citation needed] Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander will be equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV). The impact legs are made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and increased instrumentation redundancy. ISRO is working on improving the structural rigidity and adding multiple contingency systems.

                            LVM3 M4, Chandrayaan-3 - Launch vehicle lifting off from the Second Launch Pad (SLP) of SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota<br>
                            Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST as scheduled, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India. The spacecraft has been effectively placed in the trajectory it will take to reach the moon. It is anticipated that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will achieve a soft landing on the lunar South Pole region on 23 August.<br>

                            Choosing the month of July for the launch of Chandrayan 3 was a special move because of a calculation made by ISRO regarding the closeness of Earth and Moon.
